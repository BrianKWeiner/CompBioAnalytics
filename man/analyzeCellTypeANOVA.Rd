\title{Perform ANOVA on Cell Type Proportions and Post-hoc Comparisons}
\usage{
analyzeCellTypeANOVA(cellTypeDF, phenoData, pValueThreshold = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{cellTypeDF}{A dataframe of cell type proportions per sample.}

\item{phenoData}{A dataframe from the @phenoData slot of an ExpressionSet,
containing sample arms.}

\item{pValueThreshold}{The threshold for significance in post-hoc tests
(default is 0.05).}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\itemize{
\item{\code{finalResults}:}{A dataframe with Arm1, Arm2, CellType, p.value,
and corrected p.value for each significant comparison found by ANOVA and
post-hoc analysis.}
\item{\code{summaryFinalResults}:}{A dataframe summarizing the significant
cell types between each unique pair of Arm1 and Arm2. It contains three
columns: Arm1, Arm2, and CellTypes, where CellTypes is a concatenated string
of all the significant CellTypes for that arm pair.}
}
}
\description{
This function analyzes cell type proportions across different sample arms,
performs ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey tests to identify statistically significant
differences, and then summarizes the findings. It returns a list containing
both the detailed ANOVA results and a summary of cell types that showed
significant differences between arms.
}
\examples{
# Assuming 'cellTypeDF' is your cell type proportions and 'phenoData' contains the arms:
result <- analyzeCellTypeANOVA(cellTypeDF, phenoData, 0.05)
# Access the finalResults with result$finalResults
# Access the summaryFinalResults with result$summaryFinalResults
}
